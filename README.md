# Online-food-ordering-system-

Developed an Online Food Ordering program in C++ designed to provide a comprehensive customer
 experience. The system featured a menu-driven interface enabling users to browse menu categories,
 add/remove items from a cart, and calculate total order costs including taxes and delivery. It also
 incorporated customer account management (registration, updates, order history) and real-time order status
 tracking, with persistent order data managed via file I/O operations.
